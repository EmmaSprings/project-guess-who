Guess who game 

## The problem

This weeks project was about getting the guess who game provided to work so it can be played.
Javascript has been a real struggle and I still find it difficult to understand, but am happy to have made it work finally. A huge issue was to get the characters be filtered right, and one last thing I did was to not have the same value name in two categories, for example brown eyes and brown hair as that caused trouble. Fpr now I just renamed the brown eyes to go around the problem but will look more into to change the actual javascript into more code eventually.
